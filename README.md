Stock Viewer – Project Description
Stock Viewer is a full-stack web application designed for efficient stock data management and visualization. It enables users to fetch, search, sort, and manipulate stock records with seamless integration between the React frontend and Flask backend, supported by MySQL for structured data storage.


Development Approach & Methodologies
Backend Development – Flask API

Developed a RESTful API using Flask to handle CRUD operations.
Implemented a modular architecture with separate files for models, routes, services, and utilities.
Supported both JSON-based and SQL-based data models for flexibility.
Used Postman for API testing and endpoint validation.
Frontend Development – ReactJS

Built an interactive ReactJS frontend with Material-UI (MUI) for an intuitive UI.
Integrated Fetch API to retrieve stock data from Flask.
Implemented table visualization, sortable columns, search functionality, and pagination using React hooks and state management.
Database – MySQL

Structured data storage using MySQL, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
Managed database operations via Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM.
Designed queries for optimized data retrieval and manipulation.
Development & Testing Tools

VS Code – Primary code editor.
XAMPP – MySQL database management.
Postman – API testing and debugging.
Lodash (Debounce) – Optimized search queries in React.
Git & GitHub – Version control with jsonModel and sqlModel branches.
Data Visualization & Performance Optimization

Used Recharts to display line and bar charts for stock trends.
Implemented pagination (Load More button) to optimize performance and reduce API load.
Deployment & Hosting

The application will be deployed on a cloud platform for global accessibility.
Flask backend and MySQL database will be hosted remotely.
